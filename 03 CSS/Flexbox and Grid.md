# Flexbox and Grid

**Created:** 2025-03-04 15:58
**Author:** GleamTOto
**Topics:** #css #layout #flexbox #grid

## Notes
Flexbox and Grid are two powerful CSS layout systems that solve different layout problems:

**Flexbox**
is one-dimensional, working along either rows OR columns. It's perfect for arranging items within a container, especially when the size of items is unknown or dynamic.

**Grid**
is two-dimensional, working along both rows AND columns simultaneously. It's ideal for creating overall page layouts and complex alignment scenarios.

## Examples

### Flexbox Example
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
}
```

## When to Use Each

- **Use Flexbox for**:
    
    - Navigation bars
    - Card layouts with equal height
    - Centering elements
    - Distributing space among items
    
- **Use Grid for**:
    
    - Page layouts
    - Two-dimensional layouts
    - Overlapping elements
    - Complex alignment needs
