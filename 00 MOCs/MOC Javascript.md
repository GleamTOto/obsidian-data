## Fundamentals
- [[JavaScript History and Evolution]] - From creation to modern day
- [[Variables and Data Types]] - var, let, const, primitives and objects
- [[Operators and Expressions]] - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
- [[Control Flow]] - Conditionals and loops
- [[Functions and Scope]] - Declaration, expressions, arrow functions, scope chains
- [[Objects and Object-Oriented JS]] - Creating and working with objects
- [[Arrays and Array Methods]] - Working with collections of data
- [[Error Handling]] - try/catch/finally and error types

## DOM Manipulation
- [[DOM Introduction]] - Document Object Model basics 
- [[Selecting DOM Elements]] - querySelector, getElementById, etc.
- [[Modifying DOM Content]] - innerHTML, textContent, createElement
- [[DOM Events]] - Event listeners and event objects
- [[Event Delegation]] ‚≠ê - Efficient event handling pattern
- [[Browser Storage]] - localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies
- [[DOM Traversal]] - Navigating the DOM tree

## Asynchronous JavaScript

## JavaScript Patterns
- [[Module Pattern]] - Encapsulation and namespacing
- [[Prototype Pattern]] - Understanding prototype inheritance
- [[Singleton Pattern]] - Single instance objects
- [[Factory Pattern]] - Object creation methods
- [[Observer Pattern]] - Event-based communication
- [[Functional Programming in JS]] - Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions

## Web APIs

- [[Web Storage API]] - localStorage and sessionStorage
- [[Geolocation API]] - Getting user location
- [[Canvas API]] - Drawing graphics
- [[Web Workers]] - Multi-threading in JavaScript
- [[Service Workers]] - Offline capabilities and background tasks
- [[WebSockets]] - Real-time communication

## Testing and Debugging
- [[JavaScript Debugging Techniques]] - Using browser devtools
- [[Unit Testing JavaScript]] - Jest, Mocha, and testing frameworks
- [[Test-Driven Development]] - Writing tests first
- [[Common JavaScript Bugs]] - And how to fix them
- [[Performance Profiling]] - Finding bottlenecks

## Advanced Concepts

- [[Weather App - Fetch API Practice]]
- [[Quiz Application - DOM Manipulation]]

## Learning Path
1. Start with JavaScript fundamentals
2. Move to DOM manipulation
3. Learn asynchronous JavaScript concepts
4. Explore ES6+ features
5. Study patterns and advanced concepts
